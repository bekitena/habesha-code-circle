# habesha-code-circle
 Habesha Coding Circles
 This project exists to help the habesha coding community to be united and not feel lonely in their coding journey & find compatible friends, could be the same age or have the same interests..., especially for self-taught coders like me it can be very overwhelming seeing cs-majors abroad have a very fun social life & us being just stuck here feeling lonely & not building projects together. we want to have a real life , not just code, but code + reality.
    Users chooose:
    -their current coding level
    -their age-range
    -Updates will be added soon...
  They're then re-directed to a Telegram group(6-12 people).

  Each group is protected by an access code sent to them by the website before joining it, so inorder to join it they must submit the code that they received after giving their input on their current coding level & age range.

  The goal is real interaction, not large scale/numbers or fame!
    This is not:
 -A large Telegram group
 -A place to spam
 -A competition or a "flex space"
    This is:
 -Small
 -Sociable 
 -Consistnet
 -Friendly
 -Realistic
